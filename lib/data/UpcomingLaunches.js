        desc: "The X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) is an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) planned space observatory to study polarisation of cosmic X-rays. It is scheduled to be launched on 1 January 2024 on 9:10 AM IST  on a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) - C58 ,with a lifespan of at least five years. XPoSat (X-ray Polarimeter Satellite) is Indiaâ€™s first dedicated polarimetry mission to study various dynamics of bright astronomical X-ray sources in extreme conditions. The spacecraft will carry two scientific payloads in a low earth orbit. The primary payload POLIX (Polarimeter Instrument in X-rays) will measure the polarimetry parameters (degree and angle of polarization) in medium X-ray energy range of 8-30 keV photons of astronomical origin. The XSPECT (X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing) payload will give spectroscopic information in the energy range of 0.8-15 keV.",
