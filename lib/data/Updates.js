    description:
        "CE20 engine is the first indigenously developed cryogenic engine that powers the upper stage (C25) of LVM3 rocket. The engine was already qualified to operate at a thrust level of 19 tonnes and performed successfully in 6 successive LVM3 missions, including the Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3, and two commercial OneWeb missions. In order to improve the payload capability of LVM3, the upper cryogenic stage is reconfigured as the C32 stage with enhanced propellants loading and the engine operating at a thrust level of 22 tonnes. In order to operate at an increased thrust level of 22 tonnes, the engine has to be re-qualified by conducting a number of ground hot tests.CE20 engine is the first indigenously developed cryogenic engine that powers the upper stage (C25) of LVM3 rocket.
