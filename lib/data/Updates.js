            "CE20 engine is the first indigenously developed cryogenic engine that powers the upper stage (C25) of LVM3 rocket. The engine was already qualified to operate at a thrust level of 19 tonnes and performed successfully in 6 successive LVM3 missions, including the Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3, and two commercial OneWeb missions. In order to improve the payload capability of LVM3, the upper cryogenic stage is reconfigured as the C32 stage with enhanced propellants loading and the engine operating at a thrust level of 22 tonnes. In order to operate at an increased thrust level of 22 tonnes, the engine has to be re-qualified by conducting a number of ground hot tests.CE20 engine is the first indigenously developed cryogenic engine that powers the upper stage (C25) of LVM3 rocket.

            "Crew Module (CM) is where the astronauts are containedin a pressurized earthlike atmospheric condition during the Gaganyaan mission. The CM for the Gaganyaan mission is in different stages of development. For the Test Vehicle Abort mission-1 (TV-D1), the CM is an unpressurised version that has completed its integration and testing and is ready to be shipped to the launch complex. This unpressurised CM version has to have an overall size and mass of actual Gaganyaan CM. It houses all the systems for the deceleration and recovery. With its complete set of parachutes, recovery aids actuation systems and pyros. The avionics systems in CM are in a dual redundant mode configuration for navigation, sequencing, telemetry, instrumentation and power. The CM in this mission is extensively instrumented to capture the flight data for evaluation of the performance of various systems. The Crew Module will be recovered after touchdown in the Bay of Bengal, using a dedicated vessel and diving team from the Indian Navy.Crew Module (CM) is where the astronauts are containedin a pressurized earthlike atmospheric condition during the Gaganyaan mission.

            "ISRO successfully completed the CE20 E13 engine hot test for the Gaganyaan qualification and 22-tonne thrust qualification. The engine developed by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Valiamala was tested at ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri on September 22, 2023.The CE20 engine is a vital component, serving as the powerhouse of the Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) responsible for propelling the upper stage (C25) of the LVM3 vehicle. It has demonstrated its capability by successfully operating at a thrust level of 19 tonnes in six successive LVM3 missions, including the Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3, and two commercial OneWeb missions.To enhance the payload capacity of the LVM3 vehicle, ISRO is upgrading the CE20 engine. The upper cryogenic stage is being transformed into the C32 stage with increased propellant loading capacity, and the engine is being modified to operate at a higher thrust level of 22 tonnes. To ensure the engine's readiness for critical missions, a series of ground hot tests were deemed necessary. The CE20 engine hardware referred to as E13 was selected for both Gaganyaan qualification and 22-tonne thrust level operations.The journey to achieving a 22-tonne thrust capability began with E13 HT-01, a test focused on engine tuning, successfully conducted for a 50-second duration. This initial test set the stage for the upcoming trials. E13 HT-02 marked a significant milestone, conducted on August 30, 2023, with the engine operating flawlessly for an impressive 720 seconds. This test demonstrated the engine's reliability and stability.The third hot test, E13 HT-03, was the pivotal moment in completing the CE20 engine qualification for the Gaganyaan program. On September 22, 2023, this test was conducted at the state-of-the-art test facility located at IPRC, Mahendragiri. During this test, the CE20 engine operated at the coveted 22-tonne thrust level for a duration of 670 seconds. Both the engine and the testing facility performed flawlessly, meeting all the performance parameters.The successful completion of E13 HT-03 signifies the culmination of rigorous testing and the readiness of the CE20 engine for the Gaganyaan program. With all the necessary tests completed, the CE20 engine is now poised for the demanding requirements of the Gaganyaan mission and future endeavours.",
