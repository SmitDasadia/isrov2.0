  description1: `
  The Aditya-L1 (Sanskrit: आदित्य, lit: Sun) is the first space-based observatory class Indian solar mission to study the Sun and launched at	2nd September 2023 on  11:50 IST (6:22 UTC) from Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota . 
    The spacecraft is planned to be placed in a halo orbit around the Lagrangian point 1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system,
    which is about 1.5 million km from the Earth. A satellite placed in the halo orbit around the L1 point has the major 
    advantage of continuously viewing the Sun without any occultation/eclipse. This will provide a greater advantage of 
    observing the solar activities continuously.
